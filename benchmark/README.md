# `radius_perf_eval` — Copilot SDK instrumentation (Increment 1)

Control-plane code for the Radius performance benchmark. It starts an
instrumented, isolated GitHub Copilot SDK session and records everything
needed to account for a trial in time, tokens, tool calls, and AI credits.

> **This package must never appear inside a fixture given to the agent.**
> It contains benchmark control logic and would be answer leakage. See
> "Repository fixture and workspace isolation" in
> `docs/specs/copilot-radius-experiment-plan.md`.

This increment deliberately excludes the Compose trial driver, fixtures,
Inspect tasks, scenarios, and validators.

## Layout

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `copilot.py` | Session lifecycle, isolation policy, budgets, model catalog |
| `events.py` | Append-only JSONL event log, monotonic clock, tool-call timeline |
| `usage.py` | Raw + normalized usage, reconciliation (SDK-free, unit-tested) |
| `versions.py` | Provenance and CFS package-supply-chain verification |
| `smoke.py` | Exit-criterion driver (`radius-perf-smoke`) |
| `isolation_probe.py` | Deterministic fail-closed workspace isolation probes |

## Packages come from CFS only

Per "Package supply chain compliance" in the experiment plan, all packages are
acquired through Microsoft Central Feed Services. `pyproject.toml` commits a
**single** default index so CI and container builds do not depend on developer
machine settings:

```toml
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "cfs"
url = "https://packagefeedproxy.microsoft.io/pypi/simple"
default = true
```

Never add a second index or an `--extra-index-url`; multiple indexes are
treated as a dependency-confusion risk. `versions.package_supply_chain()`
re-reads this configuration and scans the lockfile for public registries, so
compliance is a *verified property* recorded in every run's provenance rather
than an assumption. `tests/test_versions.py` fails if it regresses.

CFS quarantine lag means pins must be chosen from what CFS actually serves,
not from a public registry listing.

## Running

```bash
cd benchmark
uv sync
uv run pytest                 # 115 tests, no model calls
uv run radius-perf-smoke --model gpt-5.4 --output ../artifacts/smoke
```

The smoke driver exits non-zero unless every exit-criterion condition holds.
`artifacts/` is gitignored; a curated subset is committed under
`evidence/smoke-run/` (the full `events.jsonl` is omitted for size — see
`evidence/smoke-run/events-summary.json`).

## Accounting rules

These are the invariants the unit tests exist to defend:

- **Null, never zero.** A field the provider does not report is `null`. A
  reported zero stays `0`.
- **Never sum overlapping fields.** `reasoningTokens` is a subset of
  `outputTokens`; `inputTokens` includes `cacheReadTokens`. Totals are derived
  by partition, never addition.
- **Never double count.** `session.usage.getMetrics` `agentMetrics` is a
  breakdown of the same spend as `modelMetrics`, not an addition. Only
  user-initiated calls are charged as premium requests.
- **Reconcile, never merge.** Token totals come from exactly one source,
  recorded in `usageSource`. The other source is retained verbatim and
  compared; disagreement is reported, not resolved.
- **No invented money.** Copilot reports AI credits and premium-request
  multipliers, not USD, so `cost.actualUSD` and `cost.estimatedUSD` stay
  `null`.

The `assistant.usage` event stream is preferred for token totals because it
carries the provider's billed token partition (`copilotUsage.tokenDetails`),
which yields a real uncached-input figure under prompt caching.
`session.usage.getMetrics` reports no such breakdown and is experimental, so
it serves as the independent cross-check.

`assistant.usage` is **ephemeral and never replayed** — the recorder is the
only durable copy.

## Isolation: what actually holds

File reads and writes are confined to the assigned temporary workspace, and
symlink escapes are defeated by resolving paths before checking them.

**Shell commands cannot be confined through the permission API.**
`PermissionRequestShell.possible_paths` is empty even for `cat /etc/hosts`, so
a handler that trusts it will approve escapes. Shell is therefore **disabled by
default**; when enabled, commands are screened statically for absolute, `~`,
and `..` path tokens. That screen is **best effort** — command substitution or
encoding defeats any static check. Real confinement requires the container
mount boundary in a later increment.
